### 1. Teaser Intro (30-60 seconds)
- Start with a visually appealing demo of the final chatbot on the Raspberry Pi in action, showcasing its smooth voice interaction. Highlight its responsiveness and design.
- Add a brief suspenseful narration or text overlay like, “How did we build this voice AI from scratch?”

### 2. The Concept & Inspiration
- Begin with your vision for the project and your inspiration from [Gawx](https://www.youtube.com/@GawxArt) Art, connecting art and tech storytelling.
- Include clips that visually represent your inspiration, maybe with some Gawx-style animations or storyboarding techniques. Describe how a filmmaker’s storytelling can add a unique dimension to tech development.

### 3. Project Overview (Part 1)
- Introduce the full development plan, discussing each stage from first to fifth draft.
- Explain what the project is meant to accomplish, outlining the chatbot's goals and potential uses.
- Talk on screen, discussing the initial brainstorming and research, possibly using a virtual AI assistant to convey this interaction (like text-to-text exchanges or talking to GPT, if suitable).

### 4. Development Phases (Part 2)
- First Draft (Text-to-Text Model): Capture coding and testing moments, highlighting initial interactions with a text-based AI. Mention the challenges and decisions behind choosing the right text model. Buzz words: Ollama, Llama 3.2 3B, Unsloth
- Second Draft (Local API Model): Show the chatbot running locally, with footage of coding, testing, and debugging. Describe how hosting locally adds functionality and why it’s essential.
- Third Draft (Raspberry Pi Integration): Document the process of moving the chatbot to Raspberry Pi. This is a big moment to focus on the hardware, showing how you adapted the model to work on this device.
- Fourth Draft (Voice Recognition and Text-to-Speech): Highlight the transition from text-based interaction to voice. Capture your first test voice interactions with the chatbot and your reactions.
- Fifth Draft (Final Tweaks and Closing): Wrap up development with final touches, like adding a web interface to our hosted model and adjustments to improve responsiveness or user experience.

### 5. Filmmaker’s Perspective
- Pause between drafts to share insights on filmmaking techniques applied to this project, like lighting setup for shots, sound design for voice interactions, and scene composition.
- Show behind-the-scenes footage of creating the video itself, explaining how you’re adding narrative and visual storytelling elements to engage viewers.

### 6. Challenges & Breakthroughs (Optional)
- Add a segment where you or the developer discuss obstacles encountered along the way (e.g., issues with APIs or setting up voice recognition). Include solutions you found, creating a relatable and educational moment for viewers.

### 7. End Result Reveal & Reflection
- Come full circle by showing the final chatbot in action again, similar to the teaser but with added functionality and finesse. This reveals the full journey and transformation.
- Reflect on the journey, explaining what you learned from this collaboration and how the filmmaking process shaped the project.
